# Python_Unified_Parser

Our python parser - parser.py - Combines lex and yacc functionality in a single python script using the PLY framework.

ply folder - contains the code files for the PLY framework.

yply folder - contains code for conversion of .l and .y files to ply's .py scripts. Doesn't work! :(
